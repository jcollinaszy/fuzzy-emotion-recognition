# Fuzzy emotion recognition for robot NAO

This project is a very simple experiment attempting to recognize some basic emotions ( happiness, surprise ) from users face through the camera of NAO robot in real-time. System only works on a single face within camera view and uses normalized euclidean distances of facial feature points which are fed to a simple fuzzy system for recognition.
